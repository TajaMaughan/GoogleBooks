# Google Books Search and Save
This app works with the Google Books api to populate the page with books fitting whatever search query is entered. Once results are returned they can be saved to a database. ![book search](/client/public/bookSearch.jpg)

There is also a page to display the saved books, where they can also be deleted.
The database used is MongoDB.
